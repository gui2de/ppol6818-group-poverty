# Introduction
## Policy Problem

Malawi's GDP per capita in 2024 was estimated to be between $464 and $571.93 ([World Bank, 2024](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malawi/overview#:~:text=Economic%20Overview,population%20living%20in%20extreme%20poverty)). As of 2024, World Bank projections estimated that around 72% of Malawi’s population lives in poverty, with nearly three-quarters of its people experiencing extreme poverty due to persistent food insecurity and a severe drought that has significantly affected the economy. Additionally, the country faces a substantial current account deficit, further exacerbating financial challenges. Approximately 70% of Malawians survive on less than $2.15 per day, highlighting the depth of economic hardship ([World Bank, 2024](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malawi/overview#:~:text=Economic%20Overview,population%20living%20in%20extreme%20poverty)). Thus, the policy problem we will be addressing is the prevalence of poverty in Malawi.

# Background
## Long-Term Goals

This program is motivated by four long term goals. 

1. Eradicate Extreme Poverty  
2. Eliminate Food Insecurity 
3. Diversify Industries in Which the Malawi Population Works
4. Empower Recipients Financially

Given that 70% of Malawi's population currently lives in extreme poverty, our primary goal is to reduce extreme poverty levels ([World Bank, 2024](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/malawi/overview#:~:text=Economic%20Overview,population%20living%20in%20extreme%20poverty)). Intertwined with extreme poverty is the problem of food insecurity. 5.4 million people in Malawi are experiencing moderate or severe chronic food insecurity ([Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, 2024](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1155612/)). This program aims to move Malawi toward ending chronic food insecurity.  

While eradicating extreme poverty and food insecurity are the most pressing long-term goals, this program also aims to make advancements that shift Malawi's economic trajectory. Currently, Malawi is overly reliant on its agriculture industry. In fact, in 2023, 62% of the Malawi population worked in agriculture, despite climate shocks limiting productivity ([World Bank, 2024](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS?locations=MW)). This program therefore aims to enable Malawians to explore other industries through financial support. Relatedly, this program aims to empower its recipients financially. To enable economic self-sufficiency, this program will encourage profitable entrepreneurship among those dependent on agriculture.     

### Addressing these goals

This program aims to address the long term goals mentioned above in a number of ways. First through providing the population living in extreme poverty with enough money to rise above the $2.15/day poverty line. This will reduce Malawi's population living in extreme poverty and in turn reduce food insecurity levels. Additionally, the program will help reduce dependence on agriculture for GDP and provide protection against climate shocks.

## Contextual Assumptions

This program is designed around a number of assumptions. First, it assumes that people living in extreme poverty don’t have enough money to change their situation and are therefore trapped. For example, impoverished Malawians lack sufficient funds to move out of rural areas and explore employment in other sectors. For those who are not interested in leaving the agricultural sector, a lack of capital prevents them from investing in increasing their agricultural productivity, which ultimately limits their long-term earnings. Relatedly, not having enough money prevents them from protecting their land from climate shocks. Within agriculture, workers also often lack access to key markets and information, hindering their ability to sell products at fair prices.

## Participant's Behavior and Its Impact on Outcomes

According to available data (United Nations in Malawi, 2022), very poor and poor people in Malawi spend more than half of their income (60% in urban areas and about 76% in rural areas) on food purchases, leaving little for other essential needs and limited saving capacity. Non-poor people, instead, spend 40% or less of their total income on food and they also spend on non-food items like healthcare, education, etc, and they tend to have saving patterns. Evidence from previous cash transfer programs in Malawi ([The Transfer Project, 2017](https://transfer.cpc.unc.edu/countries/malawi/)) suggests that poor and extremely poor households adjust their spending patterns, directing more resources toward essential needs such as food, healthcare, and education. A significant share is reallocated to increase food consumption, often with an emphasis on more nutritious options. Additionally, they channel part of their income into small productive investments, like livestock or agricultural tools, and use it to cover school fees, which enhances their well-being and supports higher school attendance.

While our intervention prioritizes districts with the highest levels of extreme poverty, it is also crucial to consider the 20-25% of the population who do not fall into this category. Research shows that UBI’s impact varies by socio-economic status. For those in extreme poverty, it primarily covers essential needs like food, shelter, and healthcare, leading to immediate improvements in well-being. Among the poor, it can increase consumption, enable small investments, and support debt repayment. For those who are not poor, UBI may be allocated toward savings, larger investments, or discretionary spending, enhancing financial security and economic mobility. 

There is evidence of UBI interventions in low (Basic Income Grant in Namibia, 2016) and high income countries (Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, 2019) and the outcomes are different in magnitude (huge impact in low-income countries and relatively small impact in high-income countries) but positive in both cases because this type of interventions not only moves people above the poverty line but reduces income inequality and increases opportunities ([UBI Advocates, 2021](https://ubiadvocates.org/why-ubi-works-hard-evidence-of-its-impact-on-poverty/?form=MG0AV3)).

# Our UBI program
## What Is the Intervention?

The intervention is a Universal Basic Income (UBI) program that provides each household member with $32.85 per month. To prioritize need, the program targets districts with the highest proportion of people in extreme poverty ([IFPRI, 2019](https://massp.ifpri.info/files/2019/06/Poster-on-Poverty-in-Malawi-2016-2017.pdf)). The selected districts are listed below, along with the percentage of people in poverty in each of those districts as well as how large the poverty gap is on average.  

## Target Districts

| District Name | Percent in Poverty | Poverty Gap |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Phalombe      | 83.2%              | 35.1        |
| Nsanje        | 74.3%              | 29.4        |
| Chitipa       | 73.8%              | 25.2        |

## Narrative of Initiative’s Logic
For an adult to be above the poverty line, they would need over $2.15 per day. According to the IMF, the PPP conversion factor for Malawi in 2025 is 553.1 Malawian kwacha per US dollar, which means that in Malawi, adults with daily earnings of at least 1,189.165 Malawian kwacha are above the poverty line. This is equivalent to $0.69 (US dollars). We will assume that every household below the poverty line already has at least half of this amount per day, that is $0.35 per day. Therefore, the program will provide them with $0.35/day or $10.35/month per household member. A household of 5 people, for example, would receive $51.75/month. We will distribute the money to the head of household for a duration of 10 years. The decision to distribute money for 10 years is in accordance with the finding that short-term UBIs were less effective than long-term UBIs[^3]. In terms of target area, we are choosing to prioritize the districts with the highest percentage of people in poverty. These districts — see table below — also have some of the highest percentage poverty gaps, or the largest distances to reach the poverty line. Based on these criteria, we identified the Phalombe, Nsanje, and Chitipa districts.

### Why Choose a UBI Intervention?
#### UBI versus standard unconditional cash transfer
A key advantage of UBI programs is that they simplify implementation by eliminating eligibility constraints. In contrast, targeted cash transfer programs face challenges in accurately identifying beneficiaries, as the data required to determine poverty status is often complex and unreliable. This issue is particularly pronounced in the poorest countries, where limited statistical capacity makes precise targeting even more difficult and costly.

In addition, as universal interventions ensure that all individuals receive support, regardless of their socio-economic status, this can reduce social stigma and increase public support for the program, while the higher impacts are for those who need the aid the most. Additionally, UBIs create community-wide effects that can benefit even non-poor households. Lastly, UBIs allow the study of impacts across different economic strata.

Universal interventions can also stimulate economic activity by increasing overall consumption and investment. This can lead to broader economic growth and development for the community where the intervention is being carried out. 

#### UBI for our project
When considering cash transfer models for this project, a few factors led to the decision to implement a UBI. First, in line with the previously stated long term goals, poverty alleviation was a primary consideration. A long-term UBI can provide sustained support rather than the limitations of targeted cash transfers. This can be seen from GiveDirectly’s 12-year UBI in Kenya, which showed significant benefits ([GiveDirectly, 2023](https://www.givedirectly.org/2023-ubi-results/)). 

#### Differences between Kenya and Malawi
While Kenya's UBI was a selling point, we did recognize that the impact of a UBI would look different in Malawi compared to Kenya given the vast differences between these economies. Malawi’s growth rate (4.6% in 2021) is lower compared to Kenya’s (7.6% in 2021) ([World Bank GDP Growth](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?end=2023&locations=KE&start=1983&view=chart)). Additionally, GDP per capita in 2023 was $602 in Malawi compared to $1,952 in Kenya. Malawi and Kenya also differ in their geographic placement. Unlike Kenya, Malawi is landlocked, leading to higher costs and delays in imported goods ([World Bank, 2008](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2008/06/16/landlocked-countries-higher-transport-costs-delays-less-trade)).

#### Hypothesis
While these differences could be reason to doubt the positive impact of a UBI in Malawi, we hypothesized that these discrepancies actually increased the potential of success of a UBI in Malawi. Malawi's weaker economic state stands to benefit even more from a UBI. Not only is it more urgent, but spurring economic activity and investment into alternate industries has greater potential to shift the trajectory of Malawi's economy

## How Will the Intervention Be Carried Out?

The intervention will target districts with the highest poverty rates and largest poverty gaps: Phalombe, Nsanje, and Chitipa. In terms of payment amount, instead of providing the full $2.15/day -- the standard poverty line -- households will receive $1.08/day (or $32.85/month per household member). For example, a household of 5 would receive $164.25 per month. The decision not to give the full $2.15/day is based on the assumption that the large majority of households below the poverty line already earn some revenue; therefore, partial compensation could suffice in getting them out of poverty. On the logistical front, funds will be disbursed to heads of households over a 10-year duration. Each household member will be given $1.08/day or $32.4 per month.

# Research Design

## Welfare Effects of the Intervention

The intervention we proposed is welfare-improving rather than just welfare-redistributing because it does not take money from one group to give to another in a way that reduces overall economic efficiency. Instead, it injects new resources into the economy by providing a steady flow of cash transfers, which can stimulate local demand, encourage investment, and lead to higher productivity.Unlike targeted cash transfer programs that can create competition for limited aid, this UBI does not displace existing income sources but rather supplements them, allowing recipients to improve their financial security and invest in their long-term well-being. The intervention also has a multiplier effect, as increased consumption and investment can drive economic growth, especially in impoverished regions. Additionally, by enabling spending on food, healthcare, and education, it contributes to long-term human capital gains, which are crucial for breaking the cycle of poverty. As Amartya Sen famously stated, “Poverty is not just a lack of money; it is not having the capability to realize one’s full potential as a human being.” By providing a sustained income, the UBI empowers recipients to make choices that enhance their well-being beyond mere survival. Because it does not compete for fixed resources or shift benefits between different regions, it avoids the inefficiencies of redistribution. However, the overall welfare improvement depends on how the program is funded—if financing comes from reductions in public services or increased taxation that negatively affects others, there could be a redistributive component that limits the program's net benefit. Thus, ensuring sustainable funding is essential for maximizing its positive impact.

## Considerations and Decision Rationale

After considering various conditional transfer (CT) models, the long-term UBI route was selected for its potential to produce significant long-term impacts. Despite the benefits seen in Kenya, Malawi’s distinct economic challenges (e.g., being landlocked, lower GDP per capita) suggest the UBI could have an even more transformative effect. The intervention provides less than the full $2.15/day to account for existing household income.

## Why the study matters and what we are trying to learn
First, instead of giving people the full amount to get them above the poverty line ($2.15/day or its equivalent of $0.69), the study seeks to examine how an extra boost will impact people. This is partially due to the fact that in our counties, 15-25% of the population is not in extreme poverty. We expect that those in different economic stratum will react differently to the stimulus. It’s also driven by the fact that while a huge portion of the population is in extreme poverty, we don’t know the exact amount that they are living on per day and assume it is not $0. Lastly, we hypothesize that many Malawian's people don’t need a huge amount of money to make significant improvements to their day-to-day lives.


Contextually, the study is important as this would be the first implementation of a long-term UBI in Malawi. The closest study is the UBI implemented by [Egger et al., 2022](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA17945)) in Kenya. However Kenya and Malawi differ in many ways; specifically, they are in different places financially and geographically with potential vastly different constraints on the local economy. In addition Malawi still has a huge proportion of its population working in the agricultural sector. Therefore, the impact of a UBI could be more meaningful in Malawi.


Thus, A long-term UBI could enable Malawians to invest and take risks that could spur long term growth. Malawi’s GDP growth has been low and the country continues to struggle financially. A long-term UBI here could propel more significant growth in Malawi than higher income countries, like Kenya, that have experienced long-term UBIs.


## Program Effects and Potential Externalities


### Positive Outcomes
The literature on cash transfers suggests positive multiplier effects in the local economy ([Egger et al., 2022](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA17945)). When recipients spend their UBI, it generates increased economic activity, benefiting both participants and non-participants through increased local demand and business opportunities.


### Potential Negative Externalities
While cash transfers can have a positive impact on economic growth, it is important to consider the possible consequences as well. While the intended effect is for increased economic activity, it is also possible that inflation occurs if supply chains cannot meet demand increases ([Filmer, Friedman, Kandpal, and Onishi 2021](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/105/2/327/100989/Cash-Transfers-Food-Prices-and-Nutrition-Impacts?redirectedFrom=fulltext)). Another possibility is that non-recipient households face higher prices for goods and services, since the rise in demand could increase prices for everyone.

In addition to price effects, there is the possibility that the cash transfer program could result in the migration of people from non-participating districts to participating-districts. This migration could lead to a strain on local resources and infrastructure.

### Employment Mechanisms
Currently there a number of barriers to employment in Malawi. For example, there is a lack of capital for transportation to job opportunities, starting small businesses, and skills training or education. Additionally, there is risk aversion around pursuing new types of employment due to income insecurity, as well as minimal local economic demand.

That said, a UBI could potentially address some of these barriers through providing working capital, creating safety nets for risk-taking, and fostering demand in the local economy.

### Non-Poor Population Considerations
As for the 25% of the population not in extreme poverty, a UBI could enable business expansion, increase hiring capacity, foster local economic growth, create new market opportunities, drive demand for businesses run by the poorest in the region, and protect those whom would be close to the cut off. 

## Design and Randomization

### Randomization Level
Randomization will occur at the village level across the three target districts (Phalombe, Nsanje, and Chitipa). While other methods were considered, this will be the simplest way of executing the program. Villages will be chosen randomly to avoid any bias toward certain socioeconomic or demographic groups. 

In treatment villages, all households will receive payments. Each household will receive $0.35 per day per household member. Household members include family members of the head of household or people who have been living together for at least 6 months (Beaman & Dillon, 2011). 

Across the three districts, there will be 332 villages in the sample and 20 households will be surveyed per village. Only 40% will be treated, so the total sample size will be therefore be 2,656 households (1,328 in treatment, 1,328 in control). 
### Measuring Spillovers
To account for spillover effects, as the study is conducted we will monitor the incomes and growth levels among the control villages. We will look out for patterns such as changes in earnings, local market prices, employment rates, and  business activities among control villages neighboring treatment villages. If we find such changes or any other bias, we will look into other potential causes for such changes. If we determine they are spillover effects, we will include them in the findings of our study.

## Data Collection Process 

The primary data source to understand the impact of our UBI on welfare in Malawi will be household surveys. We will conduct seven household surveys over the course of the 12-year intervention to both our treatment and control groups. These surveys would be conducted at baseline and at the 6 month mark, 1 year mark, 3 year mark, 6 year mark, 9 year mark, and the 12 year mark after the last cash transfer has been distributed. In additon to the baseline in order to gernarate a usable sampling frame we will conduc a hosehold census of all households within the targeted districts. This allows us to draw from the most accurate data when sampling for treatment and control. There is no household eligibility criteria beside being with the sample univerise (i.e. being enumerated within the census) if a village is selected all households within the village are treated. Across surveys if possible we attempt to survey the same intial respondent from the baseline, to retain some intersurvey validty.

In these surveys, we will ask questions that measure whether the indicators we are interested in change as a result of the cash transfer. Our indicators are listed below: 


### Intermediate Indicators 
What indicators will be used to measure outcomes? We will look at employment — namely, changes in employment status and any evolution of different employment sectors. Business growth, such as increases in business ownership, business metrics (such as assets, revenue, or number of employees), as well as market prices (input and outputs) will also be an indicator variable we pay attention to. Changes in market access, such as changes in the locations where people shop, the items they purchase, and the prices of the products, will also serve as a helpful indicator of impact. We will also look at food security — specifically changes to the number of meals eaten per day, food expenditure as a percentage of income, and nutritional status. Last, we will use financial health as an indicator, focusing on debt-to-income ratio, people’s savings account balances, bank account ownership, and ROSCA participation. 

Our main method of measuring changes among these indicators is simply asking participants whether they have seen changes in any of these areas. For example, we would ask participants what their employment status was before and after the cash transfer and whether the sector they are employed in has changed. However, for the product prices indicator which is in the market access section, we would also measure it using the *"mystery shopper"* technique, which is the more accurate approach to price measurement because it accurately capture mean prices paid by customers controlling by product attributes that may affect prices, such as quality, branding, and supply-chain dynamics (Fitzpatrick, 2023).

### Outputs After the Intervention
We will use the income level and income change variables as a manipulation check to confirm that the intervention had the desired effect. The income level variable measures the total income received per month. The income change variable measures changes in household income and poverty rates

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

At the outset of the program, we will  split the costs of funding the program with the Malawian government, with them paying 25% of the costs and our NGO paying 75%. Over the course of the 10 years, we will gradually transfer full financial responsibility to the government. More specifically, at the end of the first 5 years the Malawian government will be expected to pay 50% of the program costs, followed by a 10% increase each year thereafter.

The government will be able to afford this cost through international donors and international organization loans to acquire necessary initial capital. We also anticipate a multiplier effect from the UBI investment in the second half of the program that will enable the government to funnel more tax revenue toward the program in the future due to the positive impact in the economy.

## Cost of the implementation
### Administrative Costs: 
Cash will be distributed through mobile money transfers, which are the most cost-effective method with administrative costs estimated at 5-10% of the total transfer amount. The World Bank has extensively studied the cost-effectiveness of mobile money transfers in low-income countries. According to their reports, mobile money systems typically have administrative costs ranging from 5-10% of the total transfer amount, depending on the scale and infrastructure.

In terms of monitoring and evaluation (M&E), The Transfer Project, which evaluates cash transfer programs in Africa, estimates that robust M&E systems for large-scale programs typically cost between 500,000 and 1,000,000 annually, depending on the complexity and scope of the evaluation. 

Regarding staffing and training, UNICEF’s reports on cash transfer programs in Malawi and other African countries estimate that staffing and training costs for program implementation typically range from $200,000 to $400,000 annually, depending on the number of staff and the complexity of training required.
### UBI transfer costs:
The monthly UBI Amount is $0.35/day or $10.35/month per household member. Assuming an average Malawian household has 5 people, each household will receive $51.75/month. We are including 1,328 households in treatment, so the annual cost is approximately $824,688. Thus, over 10 years, the total transfer cost would be $8,246,880.

### Funding Sources
#### Initial Phase (Years 1-5):
In terms of the funding plan for the first phase of the project, international donors and NGOs will cover 75% of the costs. The Malawian government will fund the remaining 25% of the costs through business loans. The government will take out low-interest loans from international financial institutions to cover its share.

#### Transition Phase (Years 6-10):
In year 6, the government will increase its contribution to 50% of the program costs. From years 7-10, the government’s share will increase by 10% annually, reaching 100% by Year 10.

The UBI’s economic multiplier effect (estimated at 1.5-2.5x) will generate additional economic activity, further increasing the tax base. The UBI is expected to stimulate local economies, leading to higher GDP growth. For example, if Malawi’s GDP grows by 2-3% annually due to the UBI, the government could allocate a portion of the increased tax revenue to fund the program. As more people move out of poverty and into formal employment, the tax base will expand, providing a sustainable source of national funding for the UBI.
