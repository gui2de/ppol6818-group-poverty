## Rationale for HFCs
We preform two forms of quality assurance on our data first basic frequency checks on all of our variables. This provides us with three key pieces of information first are we eliciting the variation we would expect in response if not something could be arry in how we are asking the question second are we having a high number of refusals in questions this can tell us if the topic maybe confusing or more sensitive than we expected, lastly the amount of missing data this can also point towards comprehension issues depending on how exactly we allow missings to occur on a given question, skip logic issues or enumerator mistakes. Next, we preform the other form of quality assurance in the high frequency checks which is programmatic checks where we review the productivity of enumerators, duration of the survey both overall and by enumerator, and the gps coordinates of the survey. These check allow us to confirm that interviews took place in where we sampled and interviewers seem to be preforming surveys in similar time periods.
